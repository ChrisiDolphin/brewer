# Maximum Swap üîÑ

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer num. You can swap two digits at most once to get the maximum valued number.
Return the maximum valued number you can get.

## Function Description
**Function Name**: `maximumSwap`

- **Input**: A non-negative integer `num`.
- **Output**: The largest possible number after at most one swap of two digits.

## Explanation

### 1. **Convert the Number into Digits**:  
   - Extract the individual digits of the number by repeatedly taking the modulo (`% 10`) of the number and store them in a vector.
   - Since digits are extracted from least significant to most significant, reverse the vector to restore the original digit order.

### 2. **Find the Optimal Swap**:  
   - Traverse the digits from left to right. For each digit, search for the largest digit that appears after it (and is larger than the current digit).
   - If such a larger digit is found, swap it with the current digit and break the loop, as only one swap is allowed.

### 3. **Reconstruct the Number**:  
   - After performing the swap, reconstruct the number by combining the digits in the correct order.

### Time Complexity ‚è±Ô∏è
- The number of digits in `num` is `O(log10(num))`.
- Extracting and reversing the digits takes `O(log10(num))`.
- The nested loop to find the optimal swap takes `O((log10(num))^2)` since for each digit, you compare it with all subsequent digits.

Thus, the overall **time complexity** is `O((log10(num))^2)`.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- The space complexity is `O(log10(num))` due to the storage of digits in the vector.

### JAVA Approach Explanation

### 1. **Convert the Number to a String**: 
   - The integer `num` is converted to a string to facilitate easy manipulation of its digits.

### 2. **Character Array Conversion**: 
   - The string representation of the number is converted into a character array, allowing direct access to individual digits for swapping.

### 3. **Iterate Through Each Digit**:
   - An outer loop iterates through each digit of the number, starting from the leftmost digit.

### 4. **Finding the Maximum Digit**: 
   - For each digit at index `i`, an inner loop searches for the largest digit to the right. If a larger digit is found, its value and index are recorded.

### 5. **Performing the Swap**: 
   - If a larger digit is identified, a swap occurs between the current digit and the maximum digit found. This is designed to yield the maximum number with a single swap.

### 6. **Break After the First Swap**: 
   - The loop exits after the first swap to maximize the number, as further swaps are unnecessary.

### 7. **Convert Back and Return**: 
   - Finally, the modified character array is converted back into an integer and returned as the result.

### Time Complexity ‚è±Ô∏è
- The overall **time complexity** is `O((n)^2)`. This is due to the nested loops used to find the maximum digit.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- The space complexity is `O(n)` for storing the character array representing the digits of the number.
